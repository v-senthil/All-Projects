## Using ESP32 and Firebase

### Hardware:
  1. ESP32
  2. DHT22
  3. Ultra Sonic Sensor
  
  
### Software:
  1. Google's Firebase
  2. MIT App Inventor
  3. Arduino IDE
  
  
#### Smart Garbage Management System includes an ESP32 and Firebase for Database. All the sensor-based values will be stored in Database via ESP32 and those values are retrieved using an App that is made using MIT App Inventor. The whole setup will be placed on the dustbin. It will calculate the amount of garbage in the dustbin and will also be updated in the owner's app and the user's app. The user can call for garbage pickup if the user is going out of the station for a period of time. If there is any garbage in the public area, the user can send the GPS location with some information to the garbage collector. So that the respected people can come to collect it.
