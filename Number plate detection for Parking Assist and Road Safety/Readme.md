#### The process of writing down number plates is tedious and time-consuming and is prone to inaccurate recordings, furthermore, the backup and sharing of this vehicle information are difficult because the data is a hard copy. This process can be automated using Image Processing and a dedicated Android Application for owners and Policemen with automatic theft control, Email, and messaging. Road Safety on the other side is also done using the same application where the user can fail complaints regarding traffic violations, accidents, women harassment etc., which will be automatically updated in the police application. And he/she can take necessary decisions. Concluding, this proposed project can bring a new revolution in parking assist as well as road and women safety.
